# hamlib
hamlib is A cornily-named collection of some helpers I made for when I work in Raylib. It forms the basis of a game engine I'm developing for a project made in Raylib, and will be modified with the release of the play.date C SDK to hamdate to be used as a basis for my play.date games as well.
Although I have a formal degree in Computer Science, a great deal of C's true capabilities were never exposed to us in our lectures. The first textbook I purchased was K.N.Kings "C Programming - A Modern Approach" and hilariously makes use of C99. In rediscovering this book, I am learning a great deal of techniques and features that will allow me to develop hamlib / hamdate into something legitimately remarkable. It will not compete with the likes of raylib, and I have no expectation that anyone else could ever make use of this library. However, I think it's an important accomplishment for any programmer to have some sort of utility library that is legitimately useful, both as a rite of passage as well as a favor to themselves.
If you have not heard of [raylib](http://www.raylib.com), you should definitely check out the [GitHub repo](http://www.github.com/raysan5/raylib) for it.
