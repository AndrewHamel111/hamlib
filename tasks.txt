- SAT_LOOPED_N

- make drawtextaligned support multi line strings
- decide how to handle MAINT_RATIO && !SameRatio case in scaled_draw.c

IDEAS
- input manager
- general player data serialization
- sound management

CONCERNS
- GetCenterRelative and GetCenter have the wrong names, since GetCenterRelative actually returns the Global center of the rectangle and GetCenter just returns a vector with width and height / 2.

Removed hamlib/centered_draw

These features are now only accessible through ScaledDraw
