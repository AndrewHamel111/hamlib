- improving the menus
- test controller support
- current menu should have a reference to a parent menu if one exists
- improve UIElement functionality

- start inputmanager
- consider creating a dedicated event struct
- inputmanager can raise events from keyboard and mouse input
- inputmanager can raise events from gamepad input
- inputmanager has a method to enable and disable different inputs including gamepad, keyboard, touch, etc.
- BONUS inputmanager can also have external methods hooked in as inputs

- decide how to handle MAINT_RATIO && !SameRatio case in scaled_draw.c

IDEAS
- input manager
- general player data serialization
- sound management

CONCERNS
- GetCenterRelative and GetCenter have the wrong names, since GetCenterRelative actually returns the Global center of the rectangle and GetCenter just returns a vector with width and height / 2.
- A function called DrawTextureScaled exists and is confusing considering we already have ScaledDrawTexture and they do very different things.
